Unit Testing
===================


## _Writing Unit tests_ ##

    Refer to test.py for writing Unit test

    We use Python's unittest framework for testing our system.

    

## _Coverage_ ##
    
     For coverage we are using coverage.py framwork [https://pypi.org/project/coverage/]
     
     Following commands might be handy, to check the code coverage on locally, after writing new tests.
     coverage run test.py # for running the test and record coverage 
     coverage report # for reporting the coverage
     coverage html # for generating html report
     coverage xml #for reporting in xml format(Corbetura reporting on Jenkins)
